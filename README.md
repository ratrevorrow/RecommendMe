# RecommendME application

This application will allow you to keep track of the beers you've tasted at [The Flying Saucer](http://www.beerknurd.com/locations/raleigh-flying-saucer). It will also recommend random beers to you that you haven't tasted yet. If you don't have an account, you can still have the application recommend random beers to you. It also has a neat filtering feature in case you feel like a particular container type (draught, can, bottle, flight) or whether you want a local beer. On the beerlist page you can view all the beers that they currently have stocked up, and you're also able to check in any beers you've tried through that page too. If you login, a third page will appear where you can view the beers you've tried.
